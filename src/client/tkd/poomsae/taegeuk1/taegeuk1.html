Taegeuk 1 Jang represents the symbol of “Keon”, one of the 8 Kwaes (divination signs), which means the heaven and “yang”. As the “Keon” symbolizes the beginning of the creation of all things in the universe, so does the Taegeuk 1 jang in the training of Taekwondo. This poomsae is charaterized by its easiness in practicing, largely consisting of alking and basic actions, such as arae-makki, momtong-makki, momtong-jireugi, and ap-chagi. The 8th Kup-grade trainees practice this poomsae.
